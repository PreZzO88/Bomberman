# Bomberman

- Bomberman is a game of walking around walls and blowing up bricks to uncover hidden items that can be picked up, such as: 10 second armor, speed increase, bombs increase, explosion radius increase or nothing. Avoiding being killed by others and killing them increases your score, suicide decreases your score.
